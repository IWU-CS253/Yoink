**Decision-Making**

Decisions with disagreement will be made by majority rule.
In the absence of all four when a decision must be made that could result in a tie, ties will be resolved via dice or flipping a coin.

**_Group Member Expectations_**

**Check-Ins**

Each group member is responsible for giving a brief check-in on work progress or any potential issues every Saturday (3pm) and Tuesday (8pm).
Check-ins should include:
What they have accomplished
What they are working on, and when
Any technical issues
Any outside issues the group should be aware of that may affect progress
Because of the frequency of check-ins, not everyone will have "accomplished" something every check-in, which is okay.

**Responsibilities**

Show up to meetings punctually; communicate with the group if you are unable to in advance when possible
Fulfill assigned tasks by their deadlines; if there are problems, communicate with group via check-ins and just reaching out
Be available to contact when possible. Check group chat at least once a day.
Dealing with Group Members Not Meeting Obligations

Each team member is entitled to one iteration's worth of grace. If there is trouble, it is expected that they communicate with the leader or the group as a whole via check-ins and direct communication.
During a consecutive week of someone not completing their share (or if the rest of the group agrees there is a problem that needs addressing), the next meeting (or in emergency meeting if necessary) the group should discuss if they feel the circumstances justify the lack of contribution
If it is determined that there is a genuine problem with the team member's lack of contribution, they will be spoken to by the group and given a "warning"
If the problem persists, the leader will reach out to Prof. Sheese to try and find a solution
If someone stops communicating (no check-ins, does not respond to discord / email, and does not come to class) for 3+ days, it will be brought to Prof. Sheese.
If they stop communicating for 1-2 days, we will have a team meeting to address the problem before we have to pass it on to Sheese.

_**Meetings & Communication**_

Primary method of communication is the group chat

**Consequences of breach of contract:**

1. **Peer Evaluation**:
Our team will conduct peer evaluation as part of this project. Discuss group
norms for handling peer evaluations and state them here.
**Changes to contract:**
You cannot change any aspect of the team contract, particularly the "Procedures"
section, once the signed contract has been turned in to me. Therefore, be VERY
SPECIFIC on the Procedures section and spend some time thinking about this section.
The only way I will accept a change to your Team Contract is if ALL members of your
team sign and date a written amendment to your initial agreement.
